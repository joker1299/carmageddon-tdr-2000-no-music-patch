# Why do I need it

If you bought Carmageddon TDR 2000 on Steam there's no in-game music unless you use the original CD with CDDA tracks included. With this "patch" you put the music files in ogg format with some necessary files to the game folder and problem solved.

# How to use

Extract contents from the zip file to the Carmageddon TDR 2000 game folder.
